## Usage

Simply paste the program code into your browser's console (usually accessible via `F12` on most browsers). Note that the program will cease to run upon refreshing the page.

### Tampermonkey

If you wish to use this program more persistently, you can consider integrating it into a userscript manager like Tampermonkey. This will allow the program to run automatically without having to manually paste the code every time you visit a page.

## Warning

Always ensure that you understand and trust any code that you run in your browser console or install as a userscript. Running malicious or untrusted code can compromise the security of your data and personal information.
